<h2>Hi , I'm Mel👋</h2>

<p>I'm a mostly self-taught <strong>software engineer</strong> with eight years of experience in the tech industry. I love learning new technologies and pairing with others on fun, challenging problems.</p>

<p>💡 I'm currently doing a batch at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/"><strong>Recurse Center</strong></a>, where I'm working on a project that combines my joy of <strong>programming</strong> and <strong>learning Chinese</strong>.</p>

<p>⚡ Fun fact: I am fluent in Cantonese and Mandarin, as well as written Simplified and Traditional Chinese characters.</p>
